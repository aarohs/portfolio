      </p>
      <p>This experimental photography project explored the theme of separation through a fusion of portraiture and abstract photography. Inspired by Cubism, Avant Garde, and photographers like Silvia Grav, I used a photocopier instead of a traditional camera to distort the human form.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Photocopier-created distortion for “glass-paned” illusion</li>
        <li>Glitching, liquify effects, and textured overlays in Adobe Photoshop</li>

      <p>As part of the Entertainment Technology module, our group project explored Extended Reality (XR) - covering VR, AR, and MR - and focused on designing and implementing a virtual world using WebXR. Through domain analysis, solution design, prototype implementation, and evaluation planning, we tackled the specific phobia of Acrophobia (Fear of heights) within an immersive environment.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Performed domain analysis of XR technologies (VR, AR, MR) and selected Exposure Therapy as our application focus</li>
        <li>Designed a WebXR prototype using A-Frame and Three.js to create a VR Glass Elevator Exposure Therapy</li>
        <li>Implemented interactive UI/UX flows for safe, progressive exposure sessions, with real-time progress tracking and adaptive difficulty</li>
        <li>Collaborated via GitHub across a group of 5 to integrate 3D assets and ensure cross‑platform support across different browsers </li>
        <li>Sketched an evaluation plan to test therapeutic efficacy, comfort, and user engagement metrics in future user studies alongside our project report</li>
      </ul>
